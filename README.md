# Fantasy Survivor

Since season 43 of CBS's Survivor, I have organized a fantasy league in a [Google spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1r-NaIVlpTl0q5TIwV2m-TI-IbDi1KWd4HzBlzF1r6Eg/edit?usp=sharing). After 2 seasons of entering and managing data manually, I decided to take my first step into full-stack development using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node) stack.

## Project Overview

My goal was to create a web application that would automate and enhance the Fantasy Survivor experience for myself and my friends (but mostly myself).

### Scoring System

- The application has a Data Entry Page that allows me or any other admin to enter certain events or notes 
- Users can view their team's current score and ranking within the league.

## Tech Stack (MERN)

- **Frontend**: Built using React for a responsive user interface.
- **Backend**: Node.js and Express.js handle server-side logic.
- **Database**: MongoDB is used for storing user data, league information, and draft selections.

## Getting Started

Explore my live site: https://fantasy-survivor.onrender.com/

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Aidan3445/FantasySurvivor.git`.
2. Navigate to the project folder: `cd [project_folder]`.
3. Install dependencies for the frontend and backend: `npm install` (repeat this step in both the `client` and `server` folders).
4. Set up a MongoDB database and configure the connection in the server's `.env` file.
6. Configure environment variables for the frontend (in the `client` folder) and backend (in the `server` folder).
7. Start the development servers for the frontend and backend: `npm start`.

## Contributing

If you'd like to contribute to this project, feel free to fork the repository and submit pull requests. 
Any help with improving the application's features, code quality, or documentation is greatly appreciated.

## Acknowledgments

I want to thank my friends for their enthusiastic participation in the Fantasy Survivor League, which inspired me to embark on this development journey. 
Also, a special thanks to the Survivor fan community for creating valuable resources that made this project possible.
