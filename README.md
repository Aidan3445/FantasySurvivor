# Fantasy Survivor

Since season 43 of CBS's Survivor, I have organized a fantasy league in a [Google spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1r-NaIVlpTl0q5TIwV2m-TI-IbDi1KWd4HzBlzF1r6Eg/edit?usp=sharing). After 2 seasons of entering and managing data manually, I decided to take my first step into full-stack development using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node) stack.

## Project Overview

My goal was to create a web application that would automate and enhance the Fantasy Survivor experience for myself and my friends (but mostly myself).

### Scoring System

- The application has a Data Entry Page that allows me or any other admin to enter certain events or notes 
- Users can view their team's current score and ranking within the league.
- WebSockets transmit live data updates to all users on the page.

## Tech Stack (MERN)

- **Frontend**: Built using React for a responsive user interface.
- **Backend**: Node.js and Express.js handle server-side logic.
- **Database**: MongoDB is used for storing user data, league information, and draft selections.
